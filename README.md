# reverse-snake-game
a reverse snake game using python/pygame ironic how its using a snake as its mascot lol
basically in this game instead of being the snake you are the apple, you and your other apple brothers try to survive the monsterous snake from eating you. You are given 100 seconds to survive before the snake eats you. The snake grows each time it eats your apple brothers so becareful!

The original Horror game I had planned was scrapped it was named "duskfall" but due to some issues I had with switching over to Linux forgetting to backup my stuff on windows I lost major progress. So enjoy this low quality horror snake game!
